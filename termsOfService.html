            Math Equations is a group of apps or add-ons that allow a user to generate a math image for putting on the web.  As the user you have free use of the application where ever desire.  As the developer i'm not liable for what interacations my application that my application might have with your website or other extensions.  As a developer i have no intention to monitize this application by collecting data.  My only intention in developing this was to solve a problem that i personally had.

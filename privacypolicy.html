        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>Math Equations Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their `Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

        <h3>When do we collect information?</h3>

        <p>We do not collect any information from you.  All data is used within the application and not used externally.</p>

        <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

        <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

        <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>

        <p>It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

        <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
